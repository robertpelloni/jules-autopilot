# Autonomous Agents Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Please refer to [LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the master set of instructions, coding standards, and versioning protocols.

## Agent Protocols
-   **Plan**: Always outline steps before executing complex tasks.
-   **Context**: Read `LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to understand the project structure and constraints.
-   **Tools**: Use provided tools efficiently; avoid redundant calls.

## Model-Specific Notes
*   Follow the Git Workflow described in the universal instructions.
*   Prioritize "developer-first" UX in all implementations.

## Persona: Architect
- **Role**: High-level planning, system design, and roadmap management.
- **Focus**: `PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/`, and `.jules/architect.md`.
