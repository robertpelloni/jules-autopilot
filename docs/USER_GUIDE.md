## Core Features

### Session Board
The **Session Board** is your primary workspace. It visualizes all active AI sessions as cards. Each card represents a distinct task or conversation with an agent.
- **Drag and Drop:** Reorder sessions to prioritize tasks.
- **Quick Actions:** Hover over a card to access quick actions like "Archive" or "View Details".
- **Status Indicators:** Color-coded badges show the current state of each session (Active, Paused, Completed, Failed).

### Activity Feed
Clicking on a session card opens the **Activity Feed**. This is a real-time log of everything the agent is doing.
- **Streaming Output:** Watch as the agent "thinks", executes terminal commands, and edits files.
- **Code Diffs:** Changes to your codebase are displayed as unified diffs. Toggle the "Code Changes" sidebar for a file-tree view.
- **Interactive Terminal:** Expand command outputs to see full stdout/stderr logs.
- **User Input:** Send messages or instructions to the agent at any time using the input box.

### Kanban Board
For a high-level project management view, switch to the **Kanban Board**.
- **Columns:** Sessions are organized by status: Active, Paused, Completed, Failed.
- **Filtering:** Filter sessions by repository or provider.
- **Live Updates:** Drag and drop sessions to update their status. Changes are persisted automatically.

## System Dashboard

The **System Dashboard** (accessible via the sidebar or `/system`) provides a comprehensive overview of the platform's health and components.

### Submodules
Jules is built on a modular architecture. The Submodule Dashboard lists all connected components, their versions, and git status.
- **Clicking a Submodule:** Navigates to a detailed view with specific metrics and controls.

### Task Queue
The **Task Queue** submodule (`jules-task-queue`) manages background jobs.
- **Overview:** View the number of pending, running, and completed tasks.
- **Control:** Pause or resume the queue processing directly from the UI.
- **Priority:** Tasks are processed based on priority (High, Medium, Low).

### MCP Server
The **MCP Server** submodule (`jules-mcp-server`) exposes tools to the AI agent via the Model Context Protocol.
- **Tools Registry:** View a searchable list of all available tools (e.g., `read_file`, `run_command`).
- **Security:** Check which tools are restricted or require approval.

## Extensions

### Plugin Marketplace
Extend Jules functionality with plugins from the **Marketplace** (accessible via `/plugins`).
- **Browse:** Search for integrations like Jira, Slack, or VS Code.
- **Install:** One-click installation adds new capabilities to your agent.
- **Manage:** Configure or uninstall plugins from the same interface.
