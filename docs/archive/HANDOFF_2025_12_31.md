# Handoff Log - 2025-12-31

**Project:** Jules UI
**Version:** 0.6.1
**Date:** 2025-12-31

## 📝 Status Summary
The application is stable. We successfully refactored the `listArtifacts` method in `lib/jules/client.ts` to support pagination, ensuring all artifacts are fetched (not just the last 50). We also fixed a build error in the Submodule Dashboard component.

## 🔑 Recent Changes (v0.6.1)
1.  **Artifact Fetching Refactor:**
    *   Updated `listArtifacts` in `lib/jules/client.ts` to use a `do...while` loop for pagination.
    *   This fixes the issue where only a subset of artifacts were being retrieved for long-running sessions.
    *   Updated `types/jules.ts` to accurately reflect the `changeSet` and `gitPatch` structure.
2.  **Submodule Dashboard Fix:**
    *   Fixed a `TypeError` in `components/submodule-dashboard.tsx` by adding a check for `submodule.url` before calling `.replace()`.
3.  **Versioning:**
    *   Synced `VERSION.md` and `package.json` to **0.6.1**.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1.  **Deployment:** The current state (commit `1c99215`) is ready for deployment.
2.  **Roadmap Alignment:**
    *   Continue with Phase 5 (Future) items or Short Term v0.8.x goals.
    *   Specifically: **Advanced Orchestration** (Real `runCodeReview` implementation) is the next big functional block.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   Consider expanding test coverage for the new pagination logic in `listArtifacts` if not already fully covered by integration tests.

## 📦 Submodule State
*   `app/submodules.json` was generated successfully during the build.
*   Check `docs/SUBMODULES.md` (via dashboard) for the latest status.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
*   The `debate.test.ts` logs some expected errors ("Provider Error") during testing, which is normal for the current mock setup but could be cleaned up.
*   Prisma file locking on Windows remains a sporadic annoyance but is manageable.

**Handover Complete.**
