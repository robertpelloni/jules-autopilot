# Handoff Log - 2025-12-30

**Project:** Jules UI
**Version:** 0.6.2
**Date:** 2025-12-30

## 📝 Status Summary
The application is stable, built, and pushed to `main`. Major improvements were made to the Broadcast system (reactivation of old sessions), Supervisor logic (handling stalled sessions), and documentation/versioning protocols.

## 🔑 Recent Changes (v0.6.2)
1.  **Broadcast System Update:**
    *   Broadcasts now target **ALL** sessions (active, completed, failed) instead of just "active" ones. This serves as a mass-reactivation tool.
    *   Fixed a bug in `BroadcastDialog` where the session list was empty.
2.  **Supervisor Upgrade:**
    *   Updated the system prompt in `app/api/supervisor` to explicitly instruct the agent to "reactivate" sessions if they are stalled or failed.
3.  **UI Polish:**
    *   Restored "Project/Repo" details in the `SessionList` sidebar.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Created `docs/SUBMODULES.md` with a live dashboard of external dependencies.
    *   Consolidated all LLM instructions into `LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
    *   Standardized versioning workflow (VERSION file + Changelog).

## 🚀 Next Steps
1.  **Deploy:** The latest commit (`e9b6fa8`) is ready for deployment.
2.  **Verify Reactivation:** Test the new Broadcast system by sending a "Wake Up" message to a failed session and confirming it reactivates.
3.  **Feature Roadmap:**
    *   **Orchestration:** Deepen the multi-agent debate features using the `antigravity` submodule.
    *   **E2E Testing:** Expand Playwright coverage (currently basic).

## 📦 Submodule State
All submodules are initialized and synced. See `docs/SUBMODULES.md` for specific versions.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
*   Prisma file locking on Windows can occasionally cause build failures (`EPERM`). Retry usually fixes it (or closing other node processes).
*   Middleware warning: Next.js deprecation warning for "middleware" vs "proxy" (low priority).

**Handover Complete.**
